<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Lab focused on hands-on experience with Microsoft Active Directory. I performed key administrative tasks, including creating and deleting user accounts, moving users between Organizational Units (OUs), and creating a new OU for better organization. I also unlocked user accounts that were locked due to failed login attempts. The lab simulated real-world AD management tasks in a Windows Server environment.
